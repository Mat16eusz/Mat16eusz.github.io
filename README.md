## About
I am mobile apps developer for Android, I graduated IT technology at Academy of Applied Sciences in Tarnow. I started my journey with programming in 2016 with school and academy projects. Currently I am working professionally as an Android Developer. I take part in open source mobile projects. After hours away from my workdesk I like to do any kind of sport activities, especially I love gravity mountain bike riding (downhill), skiing, sport climbing, especially because of blood pumping adrenaline and passion shared with my friends.
